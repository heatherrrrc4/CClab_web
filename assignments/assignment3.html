        when I was a kid, my mom measured my height on one wall that besides the fridge, 
        using a pencil to leave a line there. We did  that almost every month.(I grow very slowly...) 
        Every time I walked pass the fridge and the wall, 
        I would notice the lines which reminded me of how many months have past.

        -- I used map() function a lot for set up a range. I will try to use if/else function to make buttoms that can offer changes for different states
